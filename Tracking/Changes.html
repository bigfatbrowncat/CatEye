<div>
	<h3 style="margin-top: 0">Change #1</h3>
	<p>Stage operations processing now doesn't stop the UI. It's not parallelized actually, it's still running 
	in the UI thread, but now it
	processes system messages and reports it's progress with a progress bar. Additionally it's possible now for the user 
	to interrupt the image processing with hitting the "Cancel" button.</p>
	<p>Introduced <b>ReportStageOperationProgressEventArgs</b> class and EventHandler<> with this EventArgs subclass contained, named 
	<i>ReportProgress</i> inside the StageOperation class.
	This event is called after every small part of the process is completed (at the discretion of the StageOperation itself) and 
	reports the progress value in percents (as a double value between 0 and 1). Also this event contains <b>Cancel</b> 
	property which should be set by the outer caller to interrupt the stage operation. Since most of stage operations
	are simply covers to some functions inside the DoublePixmap class, <b>ProgressReporter</b> delegate was created to reporting/interrupting
	these functions.
	</p>
	<p>
	If Cancel is set to true inside the handler, the process interrupts itself with the new <b>UserCancelException</b> which is handled in
	caller function.

	<p>Now the UI is updated every 10% of each stage operation progress. The longest stage operation algorithm (Ultra sharper) was impruved
	that now it updates the view immediately. It was a bit uneasy cause of the nonlocal type of the algorithm.

	<p>Images loading and importing now doesn't stop the UI. The solution is the same as Change #2. Introduced new type
	<b>ProgressMessageReporter</b> inside MainWindow class &#151; to report the message about some process and update the progress bar 
	(the assigned function should return true if "Cancel" button isn't clicked. Also now PPMLoader.FromFile and PPMLoader.FromStream functions take 
	ProgressReporter to report their progress to caller.
